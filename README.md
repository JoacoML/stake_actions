Concept:

This fast Single Page Application was developed by Joaquin Francisco Martin Lanfranchi using React.js.

Development tools:

Create React App React Router Firestore Bootstrap v5.

Functionality:

This application consumes a collection of projects stored in Firestore, in which the user will be able to choose what and how many stocks from that company to add to their shopping cart and then finalize their order with their personal data (hardcoded for now).
This order is stored in Firestore, providing the user with its tracking number.
